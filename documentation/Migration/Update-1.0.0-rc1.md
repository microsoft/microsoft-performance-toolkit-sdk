## Obsolete Members

All code decorated with the 'Obsolete' attribute has been removed.

### DataCookerPath

The following members have been removed from `DataCookerPath`:

- field `DataCookerPath.Format`
- constant `DataCookerPath.EmptySourceParserId`
- constructor `public DataCookerPath(string)`
- constructor `public DataCookerPath(string, string)`
- property `DataCookerPath.CookerPath`

To prevent build breaks, remove references to these methods and properties.

Both the constructors for `DataCookerPath` that accept string arguments and `DataCookerPath.Create` 
have been removed. 
To prevent build breaks, replace calls to this class' constructor with either
- `DataCookerPath.ForComposite`
- `DataCookerPath.ForSource`

depending on the type of data cooker the path is for.

- method `DataOutputPath.TryGetConstituents(string, out string, out string, out string)`
- method `DataOutputPath.IsWellFormed(string)`
- method `DataOutputPath.SplitPath(string)`

To prevent build breaks, remove references to these methods and properties.

Both the constructors for `DataOutputPath` that accept string arguments and `DataOutputPath.Create` 
have been removed.
To prevent build breaks, replace calls to this class' constructor with either
- `DataOutputPath.ForComposite`
- `DataOutputPath.ForSource`

depending on the type of data cooker the data output path is for.

### CustomDataProcessor

The following members have been removed from `CustomDataProcessor`:

- method `CustomDataProcessor.ProcessAsync(ILogger, IProgress<int>, CancellationToken)`

### RequiresCookerAttribute

This class has been removed. Please use `RequiresSourceCookerAttribute` or
`RequiresCompositCookerAttribute`.

### TableConfiguration

The following members have been removed from `TableConfiguration`:

- property `TableConfiguration.Layout`

### CustomDataSourceBase

This class has been removed. Please use `ProcessingSource`.

### CustomDataSourceAttribute

This class has been removed. Please use `ProcessingSourceAttribute`.

### CustomDataSourceInfo

This class has been removed. Please use `ProcessingSourceInfo`.

## SDK

The following are required if you are using the `ProcessingSource` base class and
are using the cosntructors that take `additionalTablesProvider` and/or the
`tableAssemblyProvider` parameters.

These parameters are being removed and replaced by the `ITableProvider` interface.
If you have custom logic for determining the tables exposed by a `ProcessingSource`,
you must implement the new interface.

The default behavior of using all tables found in the assembly has been preserved.
This change only effects those `ProcessingSource`s that use custom table providers.

Two helper methods have been added for use:
`TableDiscovery.CreateForAssembly` and `TableDiscovery.CreateForNamespace.` Users
may also provide their own implementations.

## Data Processors (NOT CustomDataProcessors)

`DataProcessor`s have been removed. Note that these are not the same as
`CustomDataProcessor`s; `CustomDataProcessor`s are still present as they were.

## Inheritance

The following classes have been sealed:

- `ProcessingSourceInfo`
- `ProcessingSourceAttribute`

The following methods are no longer `virtual` and are now `abstract`:

- `CustomDataProcessor.ProcessAsyncCore(IProgress<int>, CancellationToken)`

## IApplicationEnvironment

The following properties have been renamed to better indicate their purpose:
- `GraphicalUserEnvironment` -> `IsInteractive`

## Engine

The following are required if you are using the `Engine`:

### Creation

Plugins and DataSources are now loaded independently of the `Engine`. These changes were motivated by a desire to make feedback to the user about issues clearer, reduce coupling, and enable reuse. This makes the `Engine` much more powerful and flexible.

- Users will now need to create a `DataSourceSet` to pass to the `Engine` via the `EngineCreateInfo` class rather than calling the `Engine.Add*` methods.
    - See the [`Engine`](Using-the-SDK/Using-the-engine.md) documentation for more details on using `DataSourceSet`, `PluginSet`, and the `Engine` together.

As a simple example:
````cs
using (var engine = Engine.Create())
{
    engine.AddDataSource(new FileDataSource("test.txt"));
    engine.EnableCooker(cookerPath);

    // ... use the engine as desired.
}

````
becomes
````cs

using (var dataSources = DataSourceSet.Create())
{
    dataSources.AddDataSource(new FileDataSource("test.txt"));

    var info = new EngineCreateInfo(dataSources);
    using (var engine = Engine.Create(info))
    {
        engine.EnableCooker(cookerPath);

        // ... use the engine as desired.
    }
}

````

- Try-catch blocks that were expecting `UnsupportedDataSourceException`s to signal an invalid `CustomDataSource`, (now named `ProcessingSource` - see below) in any of the `Add*` methods should be updated to catch `UnsupportedProcessingSourceException`:
````cs
try
{
    dataSources.AddFile("test", typeof(BadProcessingSource))
}
catch (UnsupportedDataSourceException)
{
    // ...
}
````
becomes
````cs
try
{
    dataSources.AddFile("test", typeof(BadProcessingSource))
}
catch (UnsupportedProcessingSourceException)
{
    // ...
}
````

Note that `UnsupportedProcessingSourceException` was named `UnsupportedCustomDataSourceException` in a previous preview of v0.109.0.

- Try-catch blocks that were expecting `UnsupportedFileException`s to signal an invalid file in any of the `Add*` methods should be updated to catch `UnsupportedDataSourceExcepton`:
````cs
try
{
    dataSources.AddDataSource(new FileDataSource("test.nope"));
}
catch (UnsupportedFileException)
{
    // ...
}
````
becomes
````cs
try
{
    dataSources.AddDataSource(new FileDataSource("test.nope"));
}
catch (UnsupportedDataSourceException)
{
    // ...
}
````

## Interfaces implemented in the SDK or SDK.Runtime

There are some changes made to interfaces that generally don't need to be implemented by plugins. Those changes are documented in this section.

### ICustomDataProcessor

- Adds `TryEnableTable` method. This is similar to `EnableTable`, but catches most exceptions and returns a `bool`.

### IDataProcessorExtensibilitySupport

- The `AddTable` method becomes `EnableTable` or `TryEnableTable`.

- The `GetAllRequiredSourceDataCookers` was renamed to `GetRequiredSourceDataCookers`.

- The `GetAllRequiredTables was renamed to `GetEnabledInternalTables`.

### IDataExtensionRetrievalFactory

This was moved from the SDK namespace to SDK.Runtime.

## TableAttribute and InternalTableAttribute

- The `InternalTableAttribute` was removed.

- Internal table constructor arguments and properties have been removed from `TableAttribute`.

- An `isInternalTable` constructor argument and an `IsInternalTable` property were added to `TableDescriptor`.

Internal tables provide processing sources a way to create tables that require data cookers but do not declare build table actions. If using internal tables today, please update the table attribute and table descriptor appropriately.

### Engine Execution Results

A new parameter has been added to the constructor.

## Obsolete Code Removed

Code that was previously attributed as obsolete is now removed. In addition to some of the elements 
already called out in this document, this includes 

- References to CustomDataSource, previously renamed to ProcessingSource
- A constructor for `DataSourceInfo` that does not supply a wall clock value.

## CustomDataProcessorBase

This class has been renamed to `CustomDataProcessor`.

Obsolete virtual method `ProcessAsync` has been removed and method `ProcessAsyncCore` has been made abstract.
Please move any code from`ProcessAsync` to `ProcessAsyncCore`.

## IViewportSensitiveProjection

In addition to this interface being renamed to `IVisibleDomainSensitiveProjection`, the following properties and methods are renamed:
- `DependsOnViewport` -> `DependsOnVisibleDomain`
- `NotifyViewportChanged` -> `NotifyVisibleDomainChanged`

## ViewportSensitiveProjection

In addition to this class being renamed to `VisibleDomainSensitiveProjection`, the following properties and methods are renamed:
- `DependsOnViewport` -> `DependsOnVisibleDomain`
- `NotifyViewportChanged` -> `NotifyVisibleDomainChanged`
- `CloneIfViewportSensitive` -> `CloneIfVisibleDomainSensitive`

## IVisibleTableRegion

In addition to this class being renamed to `IVisibleDomainRegion`, the following properties and method are renamed:
- `Viewport` -> `Domain`
- `AggregateRowsInViewport` -> `AggregateVisibleRows`

Additionally, the properties `TableRowStart ` and `TableRowCount` are removed.

## Plugin Configurations
All references to "plug-in" and "PlugIn" have been changed to lowercase "plugin." In addition to the name
changes listed above, the follow references have been changed:

- The `Microsoft.Performance.SDK.PlugInConfiguration` namespace has changed to `Microsoft.Performance.SDK.PluginConfiguration`.
- `PlugInConfiguration.PlugInName` has beeen changed to `PluginConfiguration.PluginName`
