# Creating a Simple SDK Plugin

An SDK plugin uses the SDK to create a mapping between arbitrary data sources (e.g. files with 
specific formats) and 
* zero or more __tables__
* zero or more __data outputs__


A `CustomDatasource` (CDS) acts as the entry point for the SDK runtime to discover and create these mappings. 
An SDK plugin may contain more than one CDS, but it is __highly recommended__ to only include one CDS per 
assembly inside a plugin.

A standard CDS will utilize a `CustomDataProcessor` (CDP) to process the data sources that the SDK runtime provides it.

A plugin may also define __tables__ that can be used by viewers such as Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) to display the 
processed data in an organized, interactable collection of rows. Tables are discovered and passed into CDPs by the SDK 
runtime.

The SDK also supports advanced data processing pipelines through data cookers and extensions, but these topics are 
covered in the advanced documentaton. Refer to [Overview](../Overview.md) for more information.

In this tutorial, we will explore creating a simple SDK plugin that has one CDS, one CDP, and one table. 
Refer to [the following sample](../../samples/SimpleDataSource/SampleAddIn.csproj) for source code that implements the steps outlined in this file.

## Requirements of a Simple Plugin

To create a simple plugin, you must:

1. Create a public class that implements the abstract class `CustomDataSourceBase`. This is your Custom Data Source 
   (CDS)
2. Create a public class that implements the abstract class `CustomDataProcessorBase`. This your Custom Data Processor 
   (CDP)
3. Create one or more data table classes. These classes must:
   - Be public
   - Be decorated with `TableAttribute`
   - Expose a static public field or property named "TableDescriptor" of type `TableDescriptor` which provides information
     about the table. If these requirements are not met, the SDK runtime will not be able to find and pass your tables 
     to your CDP

## Implementing a Custom Data Source Class

1. Create a public class that extends the abstract class `CustomDataSourceBase`. Note that the class is decorated with 
   two attributes: `CustomDataSourceAttribute` and `FileDataSourceAttribute`. The former is used by the SDK runtime to 
   locate Custom Data Sources. The latter identifies a type of data source that the CDS can consume.

   ```cs
   [CustomDataSource(
      "{F73EACD4-1AE9-4844-80B9-EB77396781D1}",  // The GUID must be unique for your Custom Data Source. You can use 
                                                 // Visual Studio's Tools -> Create Guidâ€¦ tool to create a new GUID
      "Simple Data Source",                      // The Custom Data Source MUST have a name
      "A data source to count words!")]          // The Custom Data Source MUST have a description
   [FileDataSource(
      ".txt",                                    // A file extension is REQUIRED
      "Text files")]                             // A description is OPTIONAL. The description is what appears in the 
                                                 // file open menu to help users understand what the file type actually 
                                                 // is. 
   public class SimpleCustomDataSource : CustomDataSourceBase
   {
   }
   ```

2. Overwrite the `SetApplicationEnvironmentCore` method. The `IApplicationEnvironment` parameter is stored in the base 
   class' `ApplicationEnvironment` property.

   :information_source: In the future, this method will not need to be overridden as nothing needs to be done here

   ```cs
   protected override void SetApplicationEnvironmentCore(IApplicationEnvironment applicationEnvironment)
   {
   }
   ```

3. Overwrite the `IsFileSupportedCore` method. This is where your class will determine if a given file contains data 
   appropriate to your CDS. For example, if your CDS consumes `.xml` files, not all `.xml` files will be valid for your
   CDS. Use this method as an opportunity to filter out the files that aren't consumable by this CDS.  
   :warning: This method will be changed before 1.0 release - more details to come in patch notes.
   ```cs
   protected override bool IsFileSupportedCore(string path)
   {
      //
      // This method is called for every file whose filetype matches the one declared in the FileDataSource attribute. It may be useful
      // to peek inside the file to truly determine if you can support it, especially if your CDS supports a common
      // filetype like .txt or .csv.
      // For this sample, we'll always return true for simplicity.
      //

      return true;
   }
   ```

4. Overwrite the `CreateProcessorCore` method. When the SDK needs to process files your CDS supports, it will obtain an 
   instance of your CDP by calling this method. This is also where your CDS learns about the files, passed as 
   `IDataSource`s, that it will need to process.

   ```cs
   protected override ICustomDataProcessor CreateProcessorCore(
      IEnumerable<IDataSource> dataSources,
      IProcessorEnvironment processorEnvironment,
      ProcessorOptions options)
   {
      //
      // Create a new instance of a class implementing ICustomDataProcessor here to process the specified data 
      // sources.
      // Note that you can have more advanced logic here to create different processors if you would like based 
      // on the file, or any other criteria.
      // You are not restricted to always returning the same type from this method.
      //

      return new SimpleCustomDataProcessor(
            dataSources.Select(x => x.GetUri().LocalPath).ToArray(),  // Map each IDataSource to its file path
            options,
            this.applicationEnvironment,
            processorEnvironment,
            this.AllTables,
            this.MetadataTables);
   }
   ```

Now let's implement the `SimpleCustomDataProcessor` being returned above.

## Implementing the Custom Data Processor Class

1. Create a public class that extends the abstract class `CustomDataProcessorBase`.

   ```cs
   public sealed class SimpleCustomDataProcessor
      : CustomDataProcessorBase
   {
   }
   ```

2. Create a constructor that calls into the base class.

   ```cs
   public SimpleCustomDataProcessor(
      string[] filePaths,
      ProcessorOptions options,
      IApplicationEnvironment applicationEnvironment,
      IProcessorEnvironment processorEnvironment,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<TableDescriptor, Action<ITableBuilder, IDataExtensionRetrieval>> allTablesMapping,
      IEnumerable<TableDescriptor> metadataTables)
      : base(options, applicationEnvironment, processorEnvironment, allTablesMapping, metadataTables)
   {
      //
      // Store the file paths for all of the data sources this processor will eventually 
      // need to process in a field for later
      //

      this.filePaths = filePaths;
   }
   ```


3. Implement `ProcessAsyncCore`. This method will be called to process data sources passed into the Custom Data 
   Processor. Typically the data in the data source is parsed and converted from some raw form into something more 
   relevant and easily accessible to the processor.
   
   In this simple sample, a comma-delimited text file is parsed into event structures and stored for later use. In a 
   more realistic case, processing would probably be broken down into smaller units. For example, there might be logic 
   for parsing operating system processes and making that data queryable by time and or memory layout.

   This method is also typically where `this.dataSourceInfo` would be set (see below).

   ```cs
   protected override Task ProcessAsyncCore(
      IProgress<int> progress,
      CancellationToken cancellationToken)
   {
      ...
   }
   ```

4. Override the `GetDataSourceInfo` method. `DataSourceInfo` provides the driver some information about the data source
   to provide a better user experience. It is expected that this method will not be called before 
   `ProcessAsync`/`ProcessAsyncCore` because the data necessary to create a `DataSourceInfo` object might not be
   available beforehand.

   A `DataSourceInfo` contains three important pieces of information:
   - How long, in nanoseconds, did the first event occur relative to the start of the sources being processed
   - The duration, in nanoseconds, of the sources being processed
   - The UTC wallclock time of the start of the sources being processed

   ```cs
   public override DataSourceInfo GetDataSourceInfo()
   {
         return this.dataSourceInfo;   
   }
   ```

5. Override the `BuildTableCore` method. This method is responsible for instantiating a given table. This method is 
called for each table identified by the SDK runtime as part of this CDS (see more on this in the "Create Tables" section). 
The table to build is identified by the `TableDescriptor` passed in as a parameter to this method. If the CDP isn't interested 
in the given table, it may return immediately.

   ```cs
   protected override void BuildTableCore(
      TableDescriptor tableDescriptor,
      Action<ITableBuilder, IDataExtensionRetrieval> buildTableAction,
      ITableBuilder tableBuilder)
   {
      ...
   }
   ```
   
   How a table is created is left up to the plugin author. The sample for this documentation uses reflection to instantiate an instance of the table class.

   After the table object is created, the `ITableBuilder` parameter is used to populate the table with columns and row data. In this example, 
   the build logic exists in a `Build` method on the table, which is called by this method.

## Create Tables

Simple custom data sources provide tables as output. A table is set of columns and rows grouped together to provide output for related data. 
Tables must be created (built) to be a plugin output.

Here are the requirements for a table to be discovered by the SDK runtime:
   - Be public and concrete
   - Be decorated with `TableAttribute`
   - Expose a static public field or property named "TableDescriptor" of type `TableDescriptor` which provides information
     about the table
     
If these requirements are not met, the SDK runtime will not be able to find and pass your tables to your CDP.

Here's an example from the simple plugin example, where `TableBase` is an abstract class the simple plugin defines:

```cs
[Table]                      
public sealed class WordTable
   : TableBase
{
   public static TableDescriptor TableDescriptor => new TableDescriptor(
      Guid.Parse("{E122471E-25A6-4F7F-BE6C-E62774FD0410}"), // The GUID must be unique across all tables
      "Word Stats",                                         // The Table must have a name
      "Statistics for words",                               // The Table must have a description
      "Words");                                             // A category is optional. It useful for grouping 
                                                            // different types of tables in the viewer's UI.
}
```


Sometime after `ProcessAsyncCore` finishes (at least for typical SDK drivers who ask the SDK to build tables 
only *after* asking it to process sources), the SDK runtime will call `BuildTableCore` on your CDP for each table 
"hooked up" to it. This method receives the `TableDescriptor` of the table it must create, and is responsible for 
populating the  `ITableBuilder` with the columns that make up the table being constructed. This is most easily done by 
delegating the work of populating the `ITableBuilder` to an instance of the class/table described by the 
`TableDescriptor`.

Note that tables are "hooked up" to CDPs automatically by the SDK. **Every class that meets the requirements listed above 
is automatically hooked up to any CDPs declared in that table's assembly.**

In the sample code, the `WordTable` has a `Build` method that is called by `SimpleCustomDataProcessor`. The key code in 
this method uses the `ITableBuilder` to generate the table.

```cs
public override void Build(ITableBuilder tableBuilder)
{
   ...

   tableBuilder.AddTableConfiguration(config)
         .SetDefaultTableConfiguration(config)
         .SetRowCount(allWords.Count)
         .AddColumn(FileColumn, fileProjection)
         .AddColumn(WordColumn, wordProjection)
         .AddColumn(CharacterCountColumn, charCountProjection)
         .AddColumn(TimeColumn, timeProjection);
}
```

The `TableConfiguration` passed into `ITableBuilder.AddTableConfiguration` and `ITableBuilder.SetDefaultConfiguration` details how the table should appear.

`ITableBuilder.SetRowCount` establishes the number of rows for the table, and returns an `ITableBuilderWithRowCount`.

Each call to `ITableBuilderWithRowCount.AddColumn` establishes a column on the table. Each column requires a `ColumnConfiguration` 
to describe the column, and an `IProjection<int, T>` which map a given row index for that column to a piece of data.
