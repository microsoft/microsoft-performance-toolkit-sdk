# Introduction 
The Performance Toolkit SDK allows for you to create AddIns to process your own data to be used by viewers like Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). This project is a sample AddIn that you can use as a reference for creating your own AddIn. 
It contains a Custom Data Source (CDS) that understands files with the .txt extension and a Custom Data Processor that processes simple text files with the following format:

2/4/2019 9:40:00 AM, Word1 Word2 Word3 ...  
2/4/2019 9:41:00 AM, Word4 Word5 Word6 ...  
2/4/2019 9:42:00 AM, Word7 Word8 Word9 ...  
2/4/2019 9:43:00 AM, Word10 Word11 Word12 ...
